 * 2–6 days ago   → "Monday"
 * older, this year → "Saturday, June 20"

 *
 * The weekday rides along within the current year — feedback was that it still
 * orients ("was that a weekend?") well past the six-day band. Beyond a year it
 * stops earning its width: nobody maps "Friday" to anything a year later, and
 * the year itself needs the room.
 *
 * Deliberate deviation from the standard: the standard collapses anything over
 * ten months old to month and year ("Aug 2022"). A group label has to *identify*
 * its day — collapsing would give every day in a month the same header, so
 * scrolling old history would show a run of identical dividers with no way to
 * tell one day from the next. The day is kept and only the year is conditional.
 *
 * No ordinal suffix ("June 20", never "June 20th"), per the standard.
 *
 * `nowSeconds` is injectable so the relative bands are testable; it must stay a
 * parameter rather than a captured constant, because a label rendered before
 * midnight has to say "Yesterday" once the day rolls over.
